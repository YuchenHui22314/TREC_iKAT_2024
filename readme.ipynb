It excludes animal foods while incorporating plant-based alternatives, offering a sustainable and compassionate approach. (2) Vegan Keto: is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and moderate-protein diet which is also exclusively plant-based. It suits individuals following a vegan lifestyle who wish to adopt a ketogenic eating plan. (3) Eco-Atkins is a vegetarian variation of the Atkins diet which focuses on whole grains, vegetables, tofu, legumes, nuts, and seeds while minimizing animal products. By reducing carbohydrate intake and incorporating plant-based protein sources, it promotes sustainability and healthier eating. (4) The Ornish Diet (with limited exercise) is designed to improve overall health, support weight loss, and reverse cardiovascular disease progression, the Ornish diet is low in fat. It emphasizes exercise, stress management, and healthy relationships alongside a low-fat eating plan. It is worth noting that vegan diets, in general, have been linked to a lower risk of chronic health conditions, including heart disease. These diet options provide alternatives for individuals with specific dietary preferences and goals.\",\n",
