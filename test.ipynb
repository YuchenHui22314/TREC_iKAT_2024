(2) Vegan Keto: is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and moderate-protein diet which is also exclusively plant-based. It suits individuals following a vegan lifestyle who wish to adopt a ketogenic eating plan. (3) Eco-Atkins is a vegetarian variation of the Atkins diet which focuses on whole grains, vegetables, tofu, legumes, nuts, and seeds while minimizing animal products. By reducing carbohydrate intake and incorporating plant-based protein sources, it promotes sustainability and healthier eating.

No, there are no additional taxes for non-residents looking to purchase in France after 1 January 2021. Purchase costs will remain at around 7% for an existing property and 2% for a new-build home. What changes if I want to sell my second home in France? There are several factors to consider: Capital Gains Tax In France, there are two payments due on a capital gain, a capital gains tax (CGT) and a social levy. The standard capital gains tax on the sale of a property will remain at 19% and is only payable on a second home, if your French property is your primary residence no CGT is payable. The standard social levy charge for EU residents with a second home in France is currently 7.5% but this increases to 17.2% for British homeowners from 1 January 2021 as they will be no longer be EU residents. This means total costs will equate to 36.2%, up from 26.5%. It\\u2019s worth bearing in mind that a capital gain is largely a positive for a homeowner, it means a property asset, in the case of most French purchases, one bought for a lifestyle benefit, has also increased in value generating a return on investment. A taper relief also exists for both CGT and the social levy.\",\n",

The verifiable accuracy of all of these assertions, if facts themselves, may coincide to create the fact, that Paris is the capital of France. Difficulties arise, however, in attempting to identify the constituent parts of negative, modal, disjunctive, or moral facts. [ 17] Fact\\u2013value distinction Main article: Fact\\u2013value distinction Moral philosophers since David Hume have debated whether values are objective, and thus factual. In A Treatise of Human Nature Hume pointed out there is no obvious way for a series of statements about what ought to be the case to be derived from a series of statements of what is the case. Those who insist there is a logical gulf between facts and values, such that it is fallacious to attempt to derive values from facts, include G. E. Moore, who called attempting to do so the naturalistic fallacy . Factual\\u2013counterfactual distinction Main article: Counterfactual conditional Factuality \\u2014what has occurred\\u2014 can also be contrasted with counterfactuality: what might have occurred, but did not. A counterfactual conditional or subjunctive conditional is a conditional (or \\\"if-then\\\") statement indicating what would be the case if events had been other than they were.\",\n",

Just an hour and a half from Paris by high speed train, Dijon, the capital of the modernday region of Bourgogne - Franche- Comt\\u00e9, is a city with a very proud past. In the Middle Ages, the Dukes of Burgundy were second only in power to the Kings of France: and indeed for much of the Middle Ages, the Dukedom of Burgundy was to all intents and purposes an independent state, separate from and at times at war with the Kingdom of France. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the Duchy of Burgundy was a major European power, whose territory stretched at its peak from the North Sea (Flanders, Artois and Picardy) to the border with Switzerland, and Dijon was its capital. Since the regional reforms of 2016, Dijon has become the smallest regional capital in France apart from Orleans , and no longer occupies the position of importance that it enjoyed in medieval and Renaissance times . With a population of just over 150,000, it is far smaller than the big provincial capitals of France like Lyon or Toulouse or Strasbourg. In 2015, its historic centre was listed as a UNESCO world heritage site. Located at the northern end of the main Burgundy vineyard area, Dijon is nowadays best known as one of the wine capitals of France, and also for its famous mustard, la Moutarde de Dijon, which is known worldwide. Don't expect however to find a city surrounded by mustard fields; the yellow fields that can be seen round Dijon in the spring time are fields of colza, or oil-seed rape, not of mustard.\",\n",

No, there are no additional taxes for non-residents looking to purchase in France after 1 January 2021. Purchase costs will remain at around 7% for an existing property and 2% for a new-build home. What changes if I want to sell my second home in France? There are several factors to consider: Capital Gains Tax In France, there are two payments due on a capital gain, a capital gains tax (CGT) and a social levy. The standard capital gains tax on the sale of a property will remain at 19% and is only payable on a second home, if your French property is your primary residence no CGT is payable. The standard social levy charge for EU residents with a second home in France is currently 7.5% but this increases to 17.2% for British homeowners from 1 January 2021 as they will be no longer be EU residents. This means total costs will equate to 36.2%, up from 26.5%. It\\u2019s worth bearing in mind that a capital gain is largely a positive for a homeowner, it means a property asset, in the case of most French purchases, one bought for a lifestyle benefit, has also increased in value generating a return on investment. A taper relief also exists for both CGT and the social levy.\",\n",

      "                \"content\": \"14] Correspondence and the slingshot argument Pascal Engel's version of the correspondence theory of truth explains that what makes a sentence true is that it corresponds to a fact. [ 15] This theory presupposes the existence of an objective world. The Slingshot argument claims to show that all true statements stand for the same thing, the truth value true. If this argument holds, and facts are taken to be what true statements stand for, then one arrives at the counter-intuitive conclusion that there is only one fact: the truth.[16] Compound facts Any non-trivial true statement about reality is necessarily an abstraction composed of a complex of objects and properties or relations .\\\"Facts possess internal structure, being complexes of objects and properties or relations\\\" [ 13] For example, the fact described by the true statement \\\"Paris is the capital city of France\\\" implies that there is such a place as Paris, there is such a place as France, there are such things as capital cities, as well as that France has a government, that the government of France has the power to define its capital city, and that the French government has chosen Paris to be the capital, that there is such a thing as a place or a government, and so on. The verifiable accuracy of all of these assertions, if facts themselves, may coincide to create the fact, that Paris is the capital of France. Difficulties arise, however, in attempting to identify the constituent parts of negative, modal, disjunctive, or moral facts. [\",\n",
