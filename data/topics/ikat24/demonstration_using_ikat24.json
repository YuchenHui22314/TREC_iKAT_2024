Your legs get more robust with these exercises. You can cover a longer distance with each stride if you have stronger legs. Sufficient muscle strength will act as a foundation for power training, which depends on this strength and converts it into speed. Specialized weight training improves your running performance. Half Marathon Training with Weight Lifting You need at least two weight training sessions per week. Here is a list of great strength training exercises for runners. Compound workouts such as Trap Bar and Squats and single-leg workouts such as lunges are great ways to work out multiple muscle groups at the same time. The lunge matrix is a great strength training exercise that can be done with or without weights. To start, your body's weight is sufficient enough as a great starting point for the lunge matrix. Take complete rest for at least 45 seconds up to 3 minutes between sets. Strength training needs a longer rest period because it is more exhausting and demanding on your overall body.",

Remember that running is a priority and when push comes to shove you need to select runner-specific training (i.e. running) over strength training and cross-training. However, I would make it mandatory that you strength train at least once per week.",
