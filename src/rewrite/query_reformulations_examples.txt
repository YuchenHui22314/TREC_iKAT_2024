###### Level (a): non-personalization – the self-contained query that does not need personalization #####
# turn id:                1-2 (iKAT 2024)
# Original query:         Are all of them made of alcohol?
# Reformulated query:     Are all types of fragrances made with alcohol? 
# CoT reason by LLM:      The user's question about whether all types of fragrances are made of alcohol is a general inquiry about the composition of perfumes. While the user's profile mentions a dislike for alcohol, this preference does not significantly alter the nature of the question, which is primarily about understanding the ingredients in perfumes. The question can be answered without personalization, as it seeks factual information about fragrance composition.
# pseudo response:        Not all types of fragrances are made entirely of alcohol, but most do contain it as a solvent to help disperse the scent. Eau Fraiche, for example, has the least amount of alcohol, while Eau De Parfum and Parfum have higher concentrations of scented oils and less alcohol. Some natural or oil-based perfumes may not contain alcohol at all, using other carriers like oil or water instead. 


###### Level (b): partial personalization – the user profile serves as an extra perk, while the query itself can retrieve some general topics 
# turn id:                0-10 (iKAT 2024)
# Original query:         Yes, somewhere close to the Nile River.
# Reformulated query:     Are all types of fragrances made with alcohol? 
# CoT reason by LLM:      The user's query about accommodations near the Nile River in Cairo is fairly self-contained. While the user profile provides some insights into their interests and lifestyle, such as a love for art and environmental advocacy, these details are not crucial for finding suitable accommodations. The query can be answered with general information about hotels or places to stay near the Nile River. However, knowing the user's interest in art and environmental causes could enhance the response by suggesting accommodations that align with these interests, such as eco-friendly hotels or those with art-related themes. Nonetheless, the core of the query can be addressed without personalization.
# pseudo response:       For accommodations near the Nile River in Cairo, you might consider the Kempinski Nile Hotel, which offers luxurious rooms with views of the river and is known for its art-inspired decor. Another option is the Sofitel Cairo Nile El Gezirah, which combines modern luxury with a rich cultural experience and is located on an island in the Nile. If you're interested in eco-friendly options, the Fairmont Nile City Hotel has implemented several sustainable practices and offers stunning views of the river. These hotels provide a blend of comfort, art, and environmental consciousness, aligning with your interests.


###### Level (c): personalization – the user profile presents important and indispensable information or constraints for an accurate answer.
# turn id:                6-11 (iKAT 2024)
# Original query:         ..... How should I select a good sunscreen? Can you help me find a suitable skincare routine for my face?
# Reformulated query:     How should I select a good sunscreen for my oily, acne-prone, and dehydrated skin? 
# CoT reason by LLM:      The user's question about selecting a good sunscreen is related to their skincare routine, which has been a focus of the dialog. The user profile indicates that the user has oily, acne-prone, and dehydrated skin, which are important factors to consider when choosing a sunscreen. These skin characteristics can significantly influence the type of sunscreen that would be most suitable, such as opting for a non-comedogenic, oil-free formula that provides hydration without clogging pores. Therefore, the user profile provides important and indispensable information for accurately answering the query, as it helps tailor the sunscreen recommendation to the user's specific skin needs.
# pseudo response:        When selecting a sunscreen for oily, acne-prone, and dehydrated skin, look for a product that is labeled as non-comedogenic and oil-free to prevent clogging pores and exacerbating acne. A gel-based or water-based sunscreen can be a good option as they tend to be lighter and less greasy. Additionally, consider a sunscreen with added hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid to help maintain moisture levels in your skin. It's also beneficial to choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 to ensure adequate protection from both UVA and UVB rays. If you have sensitive skin, opt for a sunscreen with physical blockers like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, which are less likely to cause irritation.
